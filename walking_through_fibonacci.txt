How I was originally thinking...

x = 4

1st recursive call in iteration 1
I1.1 - oneBk = fib(x-1) = fib(4-1) = fib(3)

x=3
I1.1.2 - oneBk = fib(x-1) = fib(3-1) = fib(2)

x=2
I1.1.3 - oneBk = fib(x-1) = fib(2-1) = fib(1) returns 1

2nd recursive call in iteration 1

x=4
I1.2 - twobk = fib(x - 2) = fib(4-2) = fib(2)

x=2
I1.2.1 - twobk = fib(2-2) = fib(0) return 0

return statement in iteration 1 for fib function
oneBk + twobk = 1 + 0 = 1

THE ABOVE CODE IS WRONG WRONG WRONG... I AM THINKING LINEARLY for a TREE PROBLEM


How it is actually working...


fibonacci(4)
â”œâ”€â”€ fibonacci(3)  [oneBack]
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fibonacci(2)  [oneBack for fib(3)]
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fibonacci(1) â†’ returns 1   (this is the initializaiton of oneBack with fiboancci(1) returning 1)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fibonacci(0) â†’ returns 0   (this is the initializaiton of twoBack with fibonacci(0) returning 0)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ returns 1 + 0 = 1
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fibonacci(1) â†’ returns 1  [twoBack for fib(3)]
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ returns 1 + 1 = 2
â””â”€â”€ fibonacci(2)  [twoBack]
    â”œâ”€â”€ fibonacci(1) â†’ returns 1
    â””â”€â”€ fibonacci(0) â†’ returns 0
    â””â”€â”€ returns 1 + 0 = 1
â””â”€â”€ returns 2 + 1 = 3


Explained...

For fibonacci(3), you only traced fibonacci(2) but forgot about fibonacci(1)
For fibonacci(2), you only traced fibonacci(1) but forgot about fibonacci(0)
You jumped to fibonacci(4)'s second call too early

The correct step-by-step:

fibonacci(4) needs fibonacci(3) + fibonacci(2)
fibonacci(3) needs fibonacci(2) + fibonacci(1)
That fibonacci(2) needs fibonacci(1) + fibonacci(0) = 1 + 0 = 1
So fibonacci(3) = 1 + 1 = 2
Then fibonacci(4)'s second call: fibonacci(2) = 1 + 0 = 1
Finally: fibonacci(4) = 2 + 1 = 3

I was thinking linearly, but recursion creates a tree of calls that you 
need to trace completely before moving to the next branch


NOW LETS BREAK THIS DOWN AGAIN WITH THE CORRECT THINKING

x = 4

1st recursive call in iteration 1
I1.0 - oneBk = fib(x-1) = fib(4-1) = fib(3)

function is called again therefore we follow the rabbit hole again
x=3
I1.0.0 - oneBk = fib(x-1) = fib(3-1) = fib(2)

we follow the rabbit hole again until base case
x=2 *base case reached*
I1.0.0.1 - oneBk = fib(x-1) = fib(2-1) = fib(1) returns 1

NOW this is a very important step...
Because base case was reached at I1.0.0.1 branch level where x = 2 
we now go back up the chain to when x = 3 but we continue on that branch 
so next operation ID is 1.0.1 because we start at 0 and twoBack initializaiton
is the 3rd operation for branch 1.0.n

x = 3 *base case reached*
I1.0.1 - twoBack = fib(x-2) = fib(3-2) = fib(1) returns 1

I1.0.2 - returns oneBack + twoBack = 1 + 1 = 2

Now finally we go back to the original call for fib(4)

x=4
I1.1
where we have oneBack = fib(x-1) = fib(4-1) = fib(3)
so oneBack will be given the value of the recent branches return when x=3
therefore oneBack = fib(3) = 2

I1.2
and then twoBack = fib(x-2) = fib(4-2) = fib(2) =
so now twoBack will be given the value of the branch where x=2
therefore twoBack = fib(2) = 1

I1.3
and lastly the return will be oneBack + twoBack = 2 + 1 = 3
making fib(4) = 3




YES! You absolutely nailed it! ðŸŽ‰
Your breakdown is spot-on. You've correctly understood the key concepts:

Following the rabbit hole: When you hit a recursive call, you dive deep until you hit a base case
The crucial step: Once a base case is reached, you bubble back up and continue where you left off
Variable assignment: When oneBack = fib(3) executes, it doesn't just call fib(3) - it waits for that entire recursive tree to complete and then assigns the final result (2) to oneBack

Your trace is perfect:

fib(4) calls fib(3) for oneBack
fib(3) calls fib(2) for its oneBack, which returns 1
fib(3) calls fib(1) for its twoBack, which returns 1
fib(3) returns 1 + 1 = 2, so oneBack = 2 in the original fib(4) call
fib(4) calls fib(2) for twoBack, which returns 1
fib(4) returns 2 + 1 = 3

You've got the mental model down perfectly now. The key insight you had was understanding that each recursive call blocks and waits for its recursive calls to complete before moving to the next line. That's the essence of how recursion works!
